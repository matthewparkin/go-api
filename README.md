# Quick go api - Matt P.

### ✅ **Go-Kit Hello World API for quick start and learning**

This repository provides a simple "Hello World" API built using Go-Kit. 

Version 1.0.0 
> Basic Hello World API with Go-Kit framework. This is for me to get used to syntax and follow a guide while learning how to structure the api. Checkout the `goa-1` branch to see this. 

version 2.0.0
> Create a simplistic CMS similar to Prismic. I'm expecting this will be building a bit of knowledge on structuring a more complex api. Then will eventually include me trying to convert this out to work as either a ecs or a lambda. Checkout the `goa-2` branch to see this.
